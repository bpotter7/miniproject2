    <h1>Welcome to Barb Potter's Website</h1>
<body>
<p>Hi I am Barb Potter. I work as the Financial Coordinator for the Centre for Research & Education on Violence against Women and Children(CREVAWC) at UWO.  I have been with CREVAWC for approximately 12 years.  
   I was born in 1961. 
   I have many years of experiences and many forms of education; Traditional education and lived experiences.   As the financial officer at CREVAWC/UWO I work with many researchers on various projects.
   </p>
   <p>The Centre for Research & Education on Violence Against Women & Children (CREVAWC) was established in 1992 in response to a national study on the problem of violence against women, which was prompted by the murder of 14 women at École Polytechnique de Montréal in 1989. 

   We invest and conduct research that investigates systemic and structural barriers to the safety of women and children, reflecting Western's desire to serve the public interest and advance knowledge locally and globally. CREVAWC has extensive partnerships within the university and with external organizations and researchers to resolve community-based issues and generate opportunities for measurable research impact and service. 
   
   Our mission continues to be realized in response to societal and judicial issues that embed us in local, national, and global calls to disrupt cycles of gender-based violence in homes, at work and in our communities.
</p>
<p> While not working for CREVAWC at UWO, I enjoy spending time with my family, gardening and watching hockey. </p>
